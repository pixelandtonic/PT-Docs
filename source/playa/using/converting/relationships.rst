Relationship Fields
===================

Playa comes with a tool for converting Relationship fields over to it.

**Note:** Do **not** simply change your Relationship field’s Field Type setting over to “Playa”. You will lose all of your existing relationships.

Here’s how to do it:

#. Go to Add-Ons → Fieldtypes → Playa
#. Choose which fields you wish to convert in the “Convert Relationship fields?” setting, and click “Submit”
#. Update your templates to use :doc:`Playa’s template tags </templating/index>`
