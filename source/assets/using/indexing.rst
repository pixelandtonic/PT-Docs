Indexing Your Files
===================

Assets won’t actually show any files until you’ve indexed your upload
directories. You can do that fromAdd-Ons → Modules → Update Indexes. The
initial indexing might take some time, depending on how many files you
have. However future indexes should go much quicker, since Assets will
only have to index what’s changed.

You can also re-index an individual folder by clicking the “Refresh”
button at the top-right of Assets’ file manager, or from its fieldtype’s
file selection modal.
