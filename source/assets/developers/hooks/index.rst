Asset Hooks
===========

Assets has a lot of extension hooks that allow you tap into Assets operations by writing an extension. If youâ€™ve never written an ExpressionEngine extension before, you can learn how from the `EE Docs <http://ellislab.com/expressionengine/user-guide//development/extensions.html>`_.

Please note, that none of these hooks return any data.
